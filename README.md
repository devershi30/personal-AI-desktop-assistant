# personal-AI-desktop-assistant
Hello everyone,
This is my first python project. I created this project to determine what I know about about python, how can I implement AI, and what new I can learn in the future. 
This AI desktop assistant will keep on performing tasks you assign it to do while speaking to it using your PC/Desktop microphone. 
You can open websites as you like, you can play music, you can play videos, But you will have to specify the correct path in the code.
This Assistant is on its initial stage, I will be adding more features to it. 

It is just a one file code.

Sayonara!!!!
